      <description>First, we&amp;rsquo;ll create a sample Ruby app that you can use when developing your buildpack:
mkdir ruby-sample-app Create a file in the current directory called ruby-sample-app/app.rb with the following contents:
require &amp;#39;sinatra&amp;#39; set :bind, &amp;#39;0.0.0.0&amp;#39; set :port, 8080 get &amp;#39;/&amp;#39; do &amp;#39;Hello World!&amp;#39; end Then, create a file called ruby-sample-app/Gemfile with the following contents:
source &amp;#39;http://rubygems.org&amp;#39; git_source(:github) {|repo_name| &amp;#34;https://github.com/#{repo_name}&amp;#34; } gem &amp;#39;sinatra&amp;#39; gem &amp;#39;webrick&amp;#39; Finally, make sure your local Docker daemon is running by executing:</description>

      <title>Building blocks of a Cloud Native Buildpack</title>
      <link>https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/building-blocks-cnb/</link>

      <guid>https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/building-blocks-cnb/</guid>
      <description>Now we will set up the buildpack scaffolding.
Let&amp;rsquo;s create the directory where your buildpack will live:
Using the Pack CLI The buildpack new &amp;lt;id&amp;gt; command will create a directory named for the buildpack ID.
Example:
pack buildpack new examples/ruby \ --api 0.8 \ --path ruby-buildpack \ --version 0.0.1 \ --stacks io.buildpacks.samples.stacks.jammy This command will create ruby-buildpack directory which contains buildpack.toml, bin/build, bin/detect files.
Additional Parameters -a, --api Buildpack API compatibility of the generated buildpack -h, --help Help for &amp;rsquo;new&#39; --path the location on the filesystem to generate the artifacts.</description>

      <title>Detecting your application</title>
      <link>https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/detection/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/detection/</guid>
      <description>Next, you will want to actually detect that the app you are building is a Ruby app. In order to do this, you will need to check for a Gemfile.
Replace exit 1 in the detect script with the following check:
if [[ ! -f Gemfile ]]; then exit 100 fi Your ruby-buildpack/bin/detect script should look like this:
#!/usr/bin/env bash set -eo pipefail if [[ ! -f Gemfile ]]; then exit 100 fi Next, rebuild your app with the updated buildpack:</description>

      <guid>https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/build-app/</guid>
      <description>Now we&amp;rsquo;ll change the build step you created to install application dependencies. This will require updates to the build script such that it performs the following steps:
Creates a layer for the Ruby runtime Downloads the Ruby runtime and installs it to the layer Installs Bundler (the Ruby dependency manager) Uses Bundler to install dependencies By doing this, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to create arbitrary layers with your buildpack, and how to read the contents of the app in order to perform actions like downloading dependencies.</description>

      <title>Make your application runnable</title>
      <link>https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/make-app-runnable/</link>

      <guid>https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/make-app-runnable/</guid>
      <description>To make your app runnable, a default start command must be set. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to add the following to the end of your build script:
# ... # Set default start command cat &amp;gt; &amp;#34;$layersdir/launch.toml&amp;#34; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOL [[processes]] type = &amp;#34;web&amp;#34; command = &amp;#34;bundle exec ruby app.rb&amp;#34; default = true EOL # ... Your full ruby-buildpack/bin/build script should now look like the following:
#!/usr/bin/env bash set -eo pipefail echo &amp;#34;---&amp;gt; Ruby Buildpack&amp;#34; # 1.</description>

      <title>Specify multiple process types</title>

      <description>One of the benefits of buildpacks is that they are multi-process - an image can have multiple entrypoints for each operational mode. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this works. We will extend our app to have a worker process.
Let&amp;rsquo;s create a worker file, ruby-sample-app/worker.rb, with the following contents:
for i in 0..5 puts &amp;#34;Running a worker task...&amp;#34; end After building our app, we could run the resulting image with the web process (currently the default) or our new worker process.</description>

      <title>Improving performance with caching</title>
      <link>https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/caching/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/caching/</guid>
      <description>We can improve performance by caching dependencies between builds, only re-downloading when necessary. To begin, let&amp;rsquo;s create a cacheable bundler layer.
Creating the bundler layer To do this, replace the following lines in the build script:
echo &amp;#34;---&amp;gt; Installing gems&amp;#34; bundle install with the following:
echo &amp;#34;---&amp;gt; Installing gems&amp;#34; bundlerlayer=&amp;#34;$layersdir/bundler&amp;#34; mkdir -p &amp;#34;$bundlerlayer&amp;#34; echo -e &amp;#39;[types]\ncache = true\nlaunch = true&amp;#39; &amp;gt; &amp;#34;$layersdir/bundler.toml&amp;#34; bundle config set --local path &amp;#34;$bundlerlayer&amp;#34; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; bundle install &amp;amp;&amp;amp; bundle binstubs --all --path &amp;#34;$bundlerlayer/bin&amp;#34; Your full ruby-buildpack/bin/build script should now look like the following:</description>

      <title>Making your buildpack configurable</title>
      <link>https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/make-buildpack-configurable/</link>

      <guid>https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/make-buildpack-configurable/</guid>
      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s likely that not all Ruby apps will want to use the same version of Ruby. Let&amp;rsquo;s make the Ruby version configurable.
Select Ruby version We&amp;rsquo;ll allow buildpack users to define the desired Ruby version via a .ruby-version file in their app. We&amp;rsquo;ll first update the detect script to check for this file. We will then record the dependency we can provide (Ruby), as well as the specific dependency the application will require, in the Build Plan, a document the lifecycle uses to determine if the buildpack will provide everything the application needs.</description>

      <guid>https://buildpacks.io/docs/buildpack-author-guide/create-buildpack/adding-bill-of-materials/</guid>
      <description>One of the benefits of buildpacks is they can also populate the app image with metadata from the build process, allowing you to audit the app image for information like:
The process types that are available and the commands associated with them The run-image the app image was based on The buildpacks were used to create the app image And more&amp;hellip;! You can find some of this information using pack via its inspect-image command.</description>
